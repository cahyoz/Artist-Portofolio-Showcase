# Hikarin's Site

A just-for-fun proof of concept using [pixi-live2d-display](https://github.com/guansss/pixi-live2d-display)  
that spiraled into a cozy personal site with a **Live2D model**, **art gallery**, and **commission information**.

Originally made to experiment with interactive models, this site became a little playground for:

- âœ¨ Showcasing my artworks
- ðŸ§  Practicing front-end integration with Live2D
- ðŸ“Œ Sharing commission rules & process
- ðŸŒ¸ Adding a bit of personality to my online presence
